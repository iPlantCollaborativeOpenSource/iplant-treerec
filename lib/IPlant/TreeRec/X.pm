=head2 IPlant::TreeRec::DatabaseException

Thrown when a database error occurs.

=head2 IPlant::TreeRec::IllegalArgumentException

Thrown when an illegal argument value is passed to any subroutine.

=head2 IPlant::TreeRec::IOException

Thrown when a general I/O exception occurs.

=head2 IPlant::TreeRec::CloseException

Thrown when a file handle can't be closed.

=head2 IPlant::TreeRec::TreeNotFoundException

Thrown when either a gene tree or a species tree can't be found.

=head2 IPlant::TreeRec::GeneFamilyNotFoundException

Thrown when a gene family can't be found.

=head2 IPlant::TreeRec::ReconciliationNotFoundException

Thrown when a reconciliation can't be found for a specified gene tree and
species tree.
